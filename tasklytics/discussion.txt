🔐 Authentication Strategy
Auth Type: Email & Password only
User Registration: Disabled on frontend
User Creation: Done manually by Admin in Firebase Console

| Role        | Description & Permissions                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Admin**   | Full access, manage users, tasks, and view analytics   |
| **Manager** | Create/manage tasks, assign coders, view task progress |
| **Coder**   | Can create tasks (self-assigned only), view & update assigned tasks. Cannot assign coders to any task |

Firestore "User" Document Structure
{
  "name": "Ankit Rane",
  "email": "ankit@example.com",
  "role": "manager",         // "admin" | "manager" | "coder"
  "createdAt": "2025-06-16T12:00:00Z"
}

🔄 Login Flow
User logs in via Firebase Auth (email/password)
Fetch user data from Firestore (users/{uid})
Store role & profile info in app state (e.g., Redux)
Redirect based on role:
  admin: full access
  manager: task dashboard
  coder: assigned task view

🔄 Special Logic
When Coder creates a task, their UID is auto-added to assignedCoders.
Coders cannot modify the assignedCoders array.
Managers/Admins see a multi-select input to choose coders for a task.
Task status can be updated by:
Any assigned coder
Managers/Admins
